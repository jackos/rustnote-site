Future plans for this site:

- Change out Rust Playground for custom kernel API with much faster response and extra features
- Swap out Ace editor for Monaco editor with rust-analyzer running in wasm
- Make .md and .rn files behave like Jupyter notebooks, kernel will have pre-compiled popular crates
- Add file explorer and editor
- Allow saving and sharing of state and integration with Github
