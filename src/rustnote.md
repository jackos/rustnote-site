# Rustnote
Quick reference for Rust concepts.

Most cells can be run by pressing the play button.
```rust
let x = "cool";
println!("Hey {}", x);
```
Some cells are editable feel free to experiment and press play!
```rust, editable
fn main() {
	let x = "edit me!";
	println!("Edited value: {}", x);
}
```

_Note: it uses https://play.rust-lang.org/ for running the code, I'm working on a REPL that pre-compiles common crates, executes Rust code for literate programming, and allows for code completion._
