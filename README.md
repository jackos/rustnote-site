Future plans for this site:

- Change out Rust Playground for custom kernel API with much faster response and extra features
- Kernel to have pre-compiled popular crates, response for running code needs to be sub second
- Swap out Ace editor for Monaco editor with rust-analyzer running in wasm
- Make .md and .rn files behave like Jupyter notebooks, each cell run saves state
- Add file explorer and editor
- Allow saving and sharing of state and integration with Github
